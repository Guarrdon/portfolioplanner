# User Isolation Fix - Trade Ideas Showing in Wrong Tab

## 🐛 Bug Fixed

**Problem:** Shared trade ideas from User 1 were appearing in User 2's "My Trade Ideas" tab instead of "Shared With Me" tab.

**Root Cause:** ALL collaboration endpoints were hardcoded to use User 1's ID (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`), regardless of which user was actually making the request.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Backend Changes (`backend/app/api/v1/positions.py`)

Added `user_id` query parameter to **ALL** collaboration endpoints:

1. **`GET /api/v1/positions/ideas`** - Fetch user's own trade ideas
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter
   - Returns only positions where `user_id = owner`
   
2. **`POST /api/v1/positions/ideas`** - Create new trade idea
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter
   - Sets the creator as the provided user_id

3. **`GET /api/v1/positions/ideas/{id}`** - Get single trade idea
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter
   - Verifies ownership or share access

4. **`PUT /api/v1/positions/ideas/{id}`** - Update trade idea
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter
   - Only allows owner to update

5. **`DELETE /api/v1/positions/ideas/{id}`** - Delete trade idea
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter (already fixed)
   - Only allows owner to delete

6. **`POST /api/v1/positions/ideas/{id}/share`** - Share trade idea
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter
   - Verifies ownership before sharing

7. **`DELETE /api/v1/positions/ideas/{id}/unshare`** - Unshare from view
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter (already fixed)
   - Allows recipient to remove from their view

8. **`GET /api/v1/positions/shared`** - Fetch shared positions
   - Now accepts `user_id` parameter (already fixed)
   - Returns positions shared WITH the user

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/services/collaboration.js`)

Updated ALL functions to pass the current user's ID from `localStorage`:

1. **`fetchTradeIdeas()`** - Added `user_id` parameter
2. **`createTradeIdea()`** - Added `user_id` parameter
3. **`updateTradeIdea()`** - Added `user_id` parameter
4. **`deleteTradeIdea()`** - Added `user_id` parameter (already fixed)
5. **`shareTradeIdea()`** - Added `user_id` parameter
6. **`fetchSharedPositions()`** - Added `user_id` parameter (already fixed)
7. **`unshareFromMe()`** - Added `user_id` parameter (already fixed)

## ✅ Expected Behavior Now

### User 1 (Matt) - Instance 1 (Port 3000)
**"My Trade Ideas" tab:**
- ✅ Shows only trade ideas created BY Matt
- ✅ Can create new trade ideas (owned by Matt)
- ✅ Can update/delete his own trade ideas
- ✅ Can share his trade ideas with Jason

**"Shared With Me" tab:**
- ✅ Shows only positions shared WITH Matt by others
- ✅ Cannot share (not the owner)
- ❌ Cannot delete (not the owner) - can only "Remove from view"

### User 2 (Jason) - Instance 2 (Port 3001)
**"My Trade Ideas" tab:**
- ✅ Shows only trade ideas created BY Jason
- ✅ Empty initially (Jason hasn't created any)
- ✅ Can create new trade ideas (owned by Jason)

**"Shared With Me" tab:**
- ✅ Shows only positions shared WITH Jason by others
- ✅ Shows Matt's shared trade idea with "by Matt Lyons"
- ❌ Cannot share (not the owner)
- ❌ Cannot delete (not the owner) - can only "Remove from view"

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Verify Proper Tab Separation

**Instance 1 (Matt):**
1. Refresh the page (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
2. Go to "My Trade Ideas" tab
3. ✅ **Verify:** Only shows Matt's own trade ideas
4. Share a trade idea with Jason

**Instance 2 (Jason):**
1. Refresh the page (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
2. Go to "My Trade Ideas" tab
3. ✅ **Verify:** EMPTY or shows only Jason's own ideas (not Matt's)
4. Go to "Shared With Me" tab
5. ✅ **Verify:** Shows Matt's shared trade idea
6. ✅ **Verify:** Shows "by Matt Lyons" next to symbol
7. ✅ **Verify:** No Share button visible (only owner can share)
8. ✅ **Verify:** Shows X button (not trash) - "Remove from my view"

### Test 2: Create New Trade Idea for Each User

**Instance 2 (Jason):**
1. Click "New Trade Idea"
2. Create a trade idea (e.g., "TSLA - Covered Call")
3. ✅ **Verify:** Appears in Jason's "My Trade Ideas" tab
4. ✅ **Verify:** Shows Share button (Jason is the owner)

**Instance 1 (Matt):**
1. Refresh "My Trade Ideas" tab
2. ✅ **Verify:** Does NOT see Jason's trade idea (different owner)

**Instance 2 (Jason):**
1. Share the TSLA trade idea with Matt

**Instance 1 (Matt):**
1. Go to "Shared With Me" tab
2. ✅ **Verify:** See Jason's TSLA trade idea
3. ✅ **Verify:** Shows "by Jason Hall"

### Test 3: Verify Isolation of Actions

**Instance 1 (Matt):**
1. In "My Trade Ideas", try to update one of your trade ideas
2. ✅ **Verify:** Update succeeds

**Instance 2 (Jason):**
1. In "Shared With Me", try to click X button on Matt's trade idea
2. Confirm removal
3. ✅ **Verify:** Disappears from Jason's view

**Instance 1 (Matt):**
1. Check "My Trade Ideas"
2. ✅ **Verify:** Trade idea is STILL THERE (not deleted, just unshared)

## 🔑 Key Technical Details

### How User Isolation Works

1. **Frontend**: Reads `current_user_id` from `localStorage.getItem('current_user_id')`
2. **Frontend**: Passes `user_id` as query parameter in ALL API calls
3. **Backend**: Accepts `user_id` query parameter (temporary, until proper JWT auth)
4. **Backend**: Uses provided `user_id` to filter/authorize operations
5. **Database**: 
   - `positions.user_id` = owner of the position
   - `position_shares.recipient_id` = who it's shared with
   - Queries filter by the correct field based on endpoint

### Authorization Rules

| Endpoint | Who Can Access | Filter |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| `GET /ideas` | Owner | `positions.user_id = current_user` |
| `POST /ideas` | Anyone | Sets `user_id` as owner |
| `PUT /ideas/{id}` | Owner only | Must own position |
| `DELETE /ideas/{id}` | Owner only | Must own position |
| `POST /ideas/{id}/share` | Owner only | Must own position |
| `DELETE /ideas/{id}/unshare` | Recipient only | Must be shared with user |
| `GET /shared` | Recipient | `position_shares.recipient_id = current_user` |

### WebSocket Events

WebSocket connections are established per user:
- `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/collaborate?user_id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` (Matt)
- `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/collaborate?user_id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002` (Jason)

Events are broadcast to the appropriate user based on their connection.

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
```
User 1 creates trade idea → stored with user_id=1
User 2 fetches "My Trade Ideas" → backend uses hardcoded user_id=1
→ Returns User 1's ideas to User 2! ❌
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User 1 creates trade idea → stored with user_id=1
User 2 fetches "My Trade Ideas" → backend uses user_id=2 from request
→ Returns only User 2's ideas (empty initially) ✅

User 2 fetches "Shared With Me" → backend uses user_id=2 from request
→ Returns positions where recipient_id=2 ✅
→ Shows User 1's shared idea in correct tab ✅
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the fix (see testing steps above)
2. Once verified working, proceed to Option B: Distributed Architecture
   - Each user runs their own backend instance
   - Central collaboration service for message broker
   - See `DISTRIBUTED_COLLABORATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 🔒 Future: Proper Authentication

Currently using temporary `user_id` query parameter. When implementing proper JWT authentication:

1. Remove `user_id` query parameters from all endpoints
2. Uncomment `current_user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)` 
3. Use `current_user.id` instead of `test_user_id`
4. JWT token will securely identify the user

This approach makes the transition to JWT auth straightforward - just remove the query parameter and uncomment the dependency injection.
