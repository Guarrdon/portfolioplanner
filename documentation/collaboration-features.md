# Trade Idea Collaboration Features

## Overview

- Users can immediately share it with friends
- Original actual position remains unchanged

#### Entry Point 2: Collaboration Dashboard
- Dedicated hub for managing all collaborative trade ideas
- View your trade ideas and positions shared with you
- Create new trade ideas from scratch
- Manage existing collaborations

## Best Practices

1. **Add Descriptive Notes**: Explain your thesis and reasoning
2. **Use Tags**: Organize ideas by theme or timing
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep metrics and status current
4. **Document Changes**: Add comments when adjusting targets

### For Collaboration

1. **Be Selective**: Share with friends who have relevant expertise
2. **Provide Context**: Add notes explaining your thought process
3. **Engage with Comments**: Respond to questions and feedback
4. **Respect Read-Only**: Don't ask friends to modify your positions
5. **Follow Up**: Update collaborators on position outcomes

### For Organization

1. **Use Status Field**: Mark ideas as planned, active, executed, closed
2. **Archive Old Ideas**: Delete or mark as cancelled
3. **Review Regularly**: Check "Shared With Me" for new ideas
4. **Track Performance**: Note outcomes in comments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Collaborate button not working:**
- Check that you have an active internet connection
- Ensure position is an actual (Schwab) position
- Try refreshing the page and syncing positions

**Friends not appearing in share modal:**
- Verify friendships are accepted (not pending)
- Check Friends section in Settings
- Refresh the Collaboration Dashboard

**Trade idea not appearing after conversion:**
- Check Collaboration Dashboard "My Trade Ideas" tab
- Verify no error messages appeared
- Try refreshing the dashboard

**Cannot edit shared position:**
- This is expected behavior - shared positions are read-only
- Clone the position to create your own editable version
- Ask the owner if you need changes
