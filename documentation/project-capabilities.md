# Portfolio Planner - Project Capabilities

## Project Vision

The Portfolio Planner is a collaborative platform for tracking, planning, and sharing stock and option trading strategies. It integrates with the Schwab API to import real positions while supporting trade idea planning and collaboration features.

## Current Implementation Status

**Phase 1 (In Progress)**: The application consists of a React frontend with local storage, and we are actively developing a Python FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL database and Schwab API integration.
